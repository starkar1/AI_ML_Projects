Project: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon? Objective: Given the observations, determine what category of customers and under what circumstances customers are likely accept the coupons.

Part I : Analysis and Observations for Bar coupons -

1. 16% of the accepted coupons amongst all the categories of coupons were the "Bar" coupons. There are 5 total categories of coupons and the number indicates that people went with other coupons instead of the bar coupons.
2. 41% of the total bar coupons were accepted, and this coincides with the observation in #1.
3. People below the age of 25 and those who go to bar between 1-3 times a month are most likely to accept the coupons. Bar coupon target segment should be catered towards people meeting this criteria.
4. No conclusive correlation is observed between the acceptance of the coupon and occupation, marital status or income of the person.
5. No conclusive correlation is observed between the acceptance of the coupon and passengers accompanying the driver

Part II: Analysis and Observations for Expensive Restaurant coupons, Restaurant(20-50):

1. 44% of the total expensive gift coupons were accepted, less than half the coupons were accepted.
2. People are more likely to accept coupons sent at 6PM or when the restaurants were within 25 minutes distance from the driver's location.
3. People who have been 3 or fewer times to these restaurants are more likely to accept the coupons.
4. Single/Married or Unmarried with partner and people under the age of 36 are more likely to accept the coupons.
5. Income is not much of a factor for the acceptance.

Conclusion: Expensive restaurant target segment should be people single, with a partner or under the age of 36. The coupons should be sent around dinner time and when the target customer is within 25 miles radius of the restaurant. People who have been 3 or fewer times to the restaurant should be included in the target segment
